The reference Expected test suite:

 * expected_no_move_constructible_fail.cpp
 * expected_pass.cpp

... was borrowed from:

* https://github.com/viboes/std-make/tree/master/test/expected

These were modified to use boost-lite and some tests removed and/or
adjusted to match the current Expected proposal before the committee
(P0323r1). Otherwise the unit test suite is unmodified.
