The reference Expected test suite expected_pass.cpp was borrowed from:

https://github.com/viboes/std-make/tree/master/test/expected

It was modified to use boost-lite and some tests removed and/or
adjusted to match the current Expected proposal before the committee
(P0323r1). Anywhere where T and E were the same type was changed
as this Expected implementation does not support that. The checks
for whether the Expected correctly disables its copy and move
constructors if T or E doesn't provide those is disabled as this
implementation also doesn't support that. Otherwise the
unit test suite is unmodified.

Copyright remains with the Expected authors.
